# üéÆ Magnetic Cave Game

## üìù Introduction
Magnetic Cave Game is a strategic board game implemented in Java. It allows two players to compete by placing pieces on a **9√ó9** board to form a **five-in-a-row** pattern. The game supports both **Player vs. Player (PvP)** and **Player vs. AI (PvAI)** modes, where the AI uses the **Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning** to make decisions.

## ‚ú® Features
-  **Game Modes:**
  -  Player vs. Player (PvP)
  -  Player vs. AI (PvAI) (Minimax-based AI opponent)
- **Turn-Based Gameplay:** Players take turns placing pieces.
- **Move Validation:** Ensures only valid moves are allowed.
- **Winning Condition Checking:** Detects when a player achieves five in a row.
- **üß† Artificial Intelligence:**
  - **Minimax Algorithm** determines the best move.
  - **Alpha-Beta Pruning** optimizes decision-making.
- **üìä Board Evaluation:** AI prioritizes moves based on an evaluation function.

## üéÆ How to Play
1. Run the game using the Java compiler:
2. Choose a game mode:
   - **1Ô∏è‚É£ :** Player vs. Player
   - **2Ô∏è‚É£ :** Player vs. AI (Minimax)
   - **3Ô∏è‚É£ :** Exit
3. If you select **Player vs. AI**, choose whether to play as **‚ö´ Black (First Player)** or **‚ö™ White (Second Player).**
4. Enter your move by specifying the **row** and **column** (both between 1 and 8).
5. The game alternates turns until a player wins by forming a five-in-a-row sequence **horizontally, vertically, or diagonally**, or the game ends in a draw if the board is full.

## üèÅ Game Board Representation
- `_` : Empty Cell ‚ûñ
- `B` : Black Piece ‚ö´ (Player 1)
- `W` : White Piece ‚ö™ (Player 2 / AI)

##  AI Implementation
The AI opponent utilizes the **Minimax Algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning** to efficiently search for the best move. It evaluates moves based on:
- Existing **piece sequences** on the board.
- Assigning weights to potential **winning combinations**.
- Choosing moves that maximize its advantage while blocking the opponent.

### How Minimax Algorithm Works
1. **Recursive Decision Making:** The AI simulates all possible moves up to a predefined depth.
2. **Evaluation Function:** Each game state is scored based on the current positioning of pieces.
3. **Maximizing and Minimizing Players:**
   - The AI assumes **it is the maximizing player** and tries to select the move with the highest score.
   - The opponent is the **minimizing player** who aims to lower the AI's potential score.
4. **Alpha-Beta Pruning:**
   - **Alpha (Œ±):** Represents the best score the maximizer can guarantee.
   - **Beta (Œ≤):** Represents the best score the minimizer can guarantee.
   - **Pruning occurs** when a branch cannot possibly influence the final decision, significantly improving efficiency.
5. **Best Move Selection:** After evaluating all options, the AI picks the best possible move to play.

## Report Overview
The **project report** details:
1. **Game Initialization:** Menu selection for Player vs. Player or Player vs. AI.
2. **Win Conditions:** Horizontal, vertical, and diagonal five-in-a-row scenarios.
3. **AI Mechanics:** Explanation of the **Minimax Algorithm** and how it determines the best move.
4. **Evaluation Function:** Scoring system for board evaluation.
5. **Invalid Cases Handling:** Preventing incorrect moves and handling input errors.
